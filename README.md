# 2DTrees
This repo includes binary search trees and related algorithms by building a geometric application. This application will be based on 2d trees.
This project also contains below 2 methods:
1. public ListOfCrimes findPointsInRange(double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2) ->
A list of 0 or more crimes is returned. These crimes occurred within the rectangular range specified by the four parameters. The pair (x1, y1) is the left bottom of the rectangle. The pair (x2, y2) is the top right of the rectangle.
2. public Neighbor nearestNeighbor(double x1, double y1) -> 
The distance in feet to the nearest node is returned in Neighbor. In addition, the Neighbor object contains a reference to the nearest neighbor in the tree.
